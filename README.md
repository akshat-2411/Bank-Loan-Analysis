# 📊 Bank Loan Analysis

Bank Loan Analysis is a complete data analytics and visualization project designed to analyze bank loan performance, borrower behavior, and portfolio risk using SQL, Python, Power BI, and Tableau.

This project provides a data-driven approach to evaluate:

- Loan portfolio performance  
- Borrower demographics and repayment trends  
- Good vs Bad loans  
- Monthly and yearly growth patterns  
- Risk and profitability indicators
